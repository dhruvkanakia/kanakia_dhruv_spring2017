## IMDb DATASET ANALYSIS

The Internet Movie Database (abbreviated IMDb) is an online database of information related to films, television programs and video games, including cast, production crew, fictional characters, biographies, plot summaries, trivia and reviews.

In this Project, I am going to explore the Airbnb data of Boston which includes 1  flat file:

* movie_metadata
It consists of details of all the movies starting from 1916 right upto 2016. The most important parameters to consider from the dataset are information about each movies actors, directors, budget, gross, imdb rating etc.

The project digs deep into the dataset to gain insights into the film industry on the basis of 5 analysis which are somewhat related to each other.

-- The first analysis is all about visualing the data to find out different trends in it. 
## Questions covered:
*  Finding out in which year has the most number of films 
* Visualizing IMDb over the years 
* Analysing the gross trend over the years 
* REVENUE PLOT 
* 3-d plot for IMDB vs Budget vs Gross
* Is budget directly related to profit? 
* WITH WHICH FACTOS IS PROFIT ACTUALLY RELATED IN THE DATASET? 
* For the year range 2000-2020 we will find out what was their gross and budget 
* Which country has the highest number of movies? 
* Which language has the highest number of movies?

## Procedure:
Various plots between different attributes were plotted using bar/histogram to get the relationship.

## Insights:
1. It can be concluded that the number of films being released in recent has been increased significantly and the quality of movie has been impacted. 
2. The IMDb score and gross are directly related    [3dplot]
3. High Budget movies aren't really making that profit. More the budget lesser is the profit

4. The net and net_percentage which is a calculated value is not directly related to any attribute
