## IMDb DATASET ANALYSIS

The Internet Movie Database (abbreviated IMDb) is an online database of information related to films, television programs and video games, including cast, production crew, fictional characters, biographies, plot summaries, trivia and reviews.

In this Project, I am going to explore the IMDb dataset which includes 1  flat file:

* movie_metadata
It consists of details of all the movies starting from 1916 right upto 2016. The most important parameters to consider from the data set are information about each movies actors, directors, budget, gross, imdb rating etc.

The project digs deep into the dataset to gain insights into the film industry on the basis of 5 analysis which are somewhat related to each other.


So, the flow of all 5 analysis goes this way:

üëç  The three major/ core attributes of the dataset are Directors, Actors and Movies

üëç  The dependent attributes of the data set are genre and plot keywords on which movie is entirely dependent upon

üëç  The weighted attributes are gross, budget, imdb_score and two of the calculated attributes net and net_percentage

Our majority of the analysis will be focused on finding relation between core and weighted attribute to find relationship between them and understanding patterns

## In the 1st Analysis:
-- We have focused on visualizing the data to get the basic details and some important relationships within the data set. 
It covers all three major attributes with each one being mapped one on one with other attributes to find a relation.

## In the 2nd Analysis:

--After we understood the basic analysis, we will now focus on the two major attributes in the Second analysis,
The second analysis cover's best actor and best director followed by few more insights based on analysis one.

## In the 3rd Analysis: 

-- After gaining insights into the best actor and director, it's time to focus on the third major attribute i.e Movie. Movie's here are dependent on two factor's genre and key_plots.
For this analysis we will be focusing on genre trying to find out which genre movies do well on box office and which finding which core attribute does well in which genre

## In the 4th Analysis:

-- We will be focusing on the second dependent attribute which is plot keyword. Just like genre we will play around with keywords trying to figure out how much role does a plot keyword play in the movie analysis.

## In the 5th and Final Analysis:

-- We will collect all our analysis and relate it with the 5th analysis that finds best actor director combination for the top 5 genres i.e action, drama, thriller, romance and comedy.


In the end we will conclude by relating all the analysis with each other. Take for example:
--If any one is planning to make a movie which is based on genre say Action, then from 5th analysis we can figure out which is the best actor director duo to consider for an action movie.
--After selecting the action director duo, from the 4th analysis which plot keywords we can use f=in order to market the movie for more profit and gross
-- From the third analysis we can come to know what is the trend for that particular genre in recent years. Whether that particular genre is being liked by audience or not. This can help anyone to predict whether this is the right time to release that particular genre movie or not.

So, this is how our analysis can help us relate and predict whether a particular genre would be hit or not and whether it is the right time to release that movie


## ANALYSIS - 1 :
[Click Here to view First Analysis](https://github.com/dhruvkanakia/kanakia_dhruv_spring2017/blob/master/Final/Analysis/Analysis1.ipynb)

-- The first analysis is all about visualing the data to find out different trends in it. 

## Questions covered:
*  Finding out in which year has the most number of films 
* Visualizing IMDb over the years 
* Analysing the gross trend over the years 
* REVENUE PLOT 
* 3-d plot for IMDB vs Budget vs Gross
* Is budget directly related to profit? 
* WITH WHICH FACTOS IS PROFIT ACTUALLY RELATED IN THE DATASET? 
* For the year range 2000-2020 we will find out what was their gross and budget 
* Which country has the highest number of movies? 
* Which language has the highest number of movies?


## Procedure:
Various plots between different attributes were plotted using bar/histogram to get the relationship.


## Insights:
1. It can be concluded that the number of films being released in recent has been increased significantly and the quality of movie has been impacted. 
2. The IMDb score and gross are directly related

3. High Budget movies aren't really making that profit. More the budget lesser is the profit
![budget_vs_net](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10628795/25309084/275a39f8-2791-11e7-8134-2e5a0e64310e.png)
4. The net and net_percentage which is a calculated value is not directly related to any attribute

## Analysis 3: 
[Click here to view Analysis 3](https://github.com/dhruvkanakia/kanakia_dhruv_spring2017/blob/master/Final/Analysis/Analysis3.ipynb)

-- After visualizing the basic data and analyzing the two most important attributes of the dataset(Actors and Directors), It's now time to dig into movie's the third most important component of the data set.
So this analysis is completely based on movie related attributes


## Questions Covered:
* Which are the genre's in the data set?
* Which are the top5 most used genre?
* Which genre manages to get the highest imdb rating?
* Top 5 genre's distribution over the years?
* List of Best actor's in top 5 genres
* Most consistent actor 



## Procedure:
* The genre's column was cleaned and split amongst each director and actor to analyze various details.
The below code is used to separate the three actors list with different genre's

``` python
df_actor = pd.DataFrame(columns = ['actor_123','genre', 'budget', 'gross', 'year','director_name','imdb_score','net','net_percentage','movie_title'])

def actorRemap(row):
    global df_actor
    d = {}
    actors = np.array(row['actors'].split(','))
    n = actors.size
    d['actors']= [row['actors']]*n
    d['genre']= [row['genre']]*n
    d['budget'] = [row['budget']]*n
    d['gross'] = [row['gross']]*n
    d['year'] = [row['year']]*n
    d['director_name']= [row['director_name']]*n
    d['imdb_score']=[row['imdb_score']]*n
    d['net']= [row['net']]*n
    d['net_percentage']= [row['net_percentage']]*n
    d['movie_title']= [row['movie_title']]*n
    d['actor_123'], d['actors_list1'] = [], []
    for actor_123 in actors:
        d['actor_123'].append(actor_123)
        d['actors_list1'].append(actors[actors != actor_123])
    df_actor = df_actor.append(pd.DataFrame(d), ignore_index = True)

df_genre.apply(actorRemap, axis = 1)
df_actor['year'] = df_actor['year'].astype(np.int16)
df_actor = df_actor[['actor_123','genre', 'budget', 'gross', 'year','actors_list1','director_name','imdb_score','net','net_percentage','movie_title']]
```

* Bar plots are used to visualize which genre's have been used most number of times in the data set
* A csv of top 10 actors in each of the top 5 genre's is created and wordcloud's are plotted to find out which actor is the most versatile of all.



## Insights:
1. All in all there are 22 genre's in the data set


![all_wc](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/10628795/25309462/d98b2812-279b-11e7-9b35-b7b5cff5e8a9.png)

2. Drama has the highest mean imdb rating in the dataset followed by crime, mystery, adventure and romance

## Procedures:

This procedure is used to find out the most worked pair in action genre

``` python
df1_action= df1.loc[df1['genres'].str.contains('Action')].dropna()
df_dir_act_action = pd.melt(df1_action,id_vars=['director_name'], value_vars=['actor_1_name','actor_2_name','actor_3_name'], value_name='actor').dropna()
# df_dir_act_sort_action
df_dir_act_sort_action= df_dir_act_action[['director_name','actor']].groupby(['director_name','actor']).size().sort_values(ascending = False).reset_index()[:40]
```

## Insights:

1. The mean imdb plot of action vs other genres clearly shows action has not done well when compared with other genre
